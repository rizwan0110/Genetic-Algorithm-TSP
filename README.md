# Genetic-Algorithm-TSP

The Traveling Salesman Problem is an optimization problem in which a salesman must visit a number of cities, and the total tour distance between them should be minimal. Aim is to find the optimal solution in which cities should be visited to shorten the total travel distance. An effective chromosome representation, a carefully designed crossover, and mutation operators are needed in the Genetic Algorithm to achieve satisfied result. The objective of this study is to solve TSP using Genetic Algorithm’s approach.

The genetic algorithm system starts with the ‘n’ number of initial population and their distance calculated between the cities using python list. Genetic algorithms use techniques inspired by evolutionary methods such as mutation, crossover, and selection. Then new generations are formed repetitively by each of the operation.
The genetic algorithm is based on the natural process of evolution. In nature, the most appropriate individuals have more possibilities of surviving and it will bring more adapted successors, who will be healthier than their parents. The same idea is applied by creating a new generation of solutions that are nearer to the required solution. A genetic algorithm consists mainly these steps: Fitness, selection, crossover, mutation.

Below are the steps did in the code

1.Creating initial population.

2.Calculating fitness.

3.Selecting the best genes.

4.Crossing over.

5.Mutating to introduce variations.


->The code is saved in the the jupyter notebook file format

->The pynb file can be exectued by importing in jupyter notebook or visual studio.

->The sample data (city_data) contains the data set which needs to be imported in the program.
